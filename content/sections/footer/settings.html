                    Villagers can be favorited, where they are accessible
                    from a special <em>Favorites</em> section<!--, and any page
                    that lists specific villager attributes can be filtered to only
                    show <em>favorited</em> villagers-->. A villager can be favorited
                    or un-favorited from their respective page.

                <h4>Preferred Language for Villager Names</h4>

                <hr />

                <p>
                    Almost all villagers have both <em>English</em> and <em>Japanese</em> names. Pages such as <em>Favorites</em>, <em>Upcoming</em>, and any page under the <em>By Attributes</em> section will list a villager by their name in the preferred language. A villager's personal page lists both languages, with the preferred being emphasized. Villagers are also listed and ordered in the navigation menu by their preferred name. By default, <em>English</em> is the preferred language.

                    <form>
                        <p>Set the preferred language: </p>
                        
                        <label>English: 
                            <input class="language-change-button" type="radio" name="preferred-language" value="english"/>
                        </label>

                        <label>Japanese: 
                            <input class="language-change-button" type="radio" name="preferred-language" value="japanese"/>
                        </label>

                    </form>

            <div class="setting">
                <h4>Maximum Upcoming Villagers</h4>

                <hr />

                <p>
                    In the <em>Upcoming</em> tab, villagers are listed by their name, birthday, and star sign, along with a photo of the villager; they are sorted by birthday (or star sign as a fallback), with the soonest birthdays coming first. This value will act as an upper-bound on the number of villagers that will be listed. By default, this value is <em>-1</em>, which will result in there being <em>no upper-bound</em>, and all villagers will be shown.

                    <form>
                        <button class="footer-button" id="reset-upcoming-limit">Reset</button>

                        <label>Set the upper-bound: 
                            <input id="change-upcoming-limit" type="number" />
                        </label>
